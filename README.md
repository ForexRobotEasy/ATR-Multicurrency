# ATR Multicurrency Trading Algorithm

This is an automated trading algorithm designed to trade multiple currency pairs. The algorithm checks for optimal market entry points and executes trades accordingly. The algorithm is designed to operate during night-time only.

## Features

- Trades multiple currency pairs: 'USDCHF', 'GBPUSD', 'EURUSD'.
- - Checks for optimal market entry points.
  - - Executes trades only during night-time.
    - - Uses ATR (Average True Range) for volatility assessment.
